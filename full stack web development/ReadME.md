## The Full Stack Web Development Course

### Contents
The sections are listed below. Some bits of notes I took are written under each section. Codes for each section is found in the folders.

1. HTML
- Block level elemenst: Start on a new line, take the whole width.
- Inline: Start where they are and take only necessary width.
- Besides `ul`, `li` there is `dd` or description list.
- After floats, you need to clear it with a div having style `clear:both`

2. HTML5
- Semantic tags: header, nav, main, article, aside(sidebar), footer
- Audio and Video tags, inc/dec volume, play, pause from js etc.
- HTML5 canvas manipulation using js.
- svg tag manipulation using XML. Basically use tags for shapes and all.
- storages store key value pairs. set and get items from local storage using js. First put checks for if browser can use local storage. Things will remain in this storage until you clear your cache, even if you close your browser. Use session storage to remove stuff when you close your browser. In chrome deve tools > application > session/local storage, you can see your stuff.
- With a couple of tiny js functions we can implement drag and drop. 
- Use `contenteditabe=true` and your content will be editable.
- For gelocation also, check if browser can use it.
